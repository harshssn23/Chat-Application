# Chat-Application

Developed a real-time chat application using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. The app displays user chats on the homepage and allows users to create, read, update, and delete messages. Each chat entry records details like sender, recipient, message content, and timestamp. Leveraged Express routing to handle CRUD operations and MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
